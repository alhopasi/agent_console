## Agent Console
Project for a console type webpage, that will be used in an event, where a game is played.

The game is about wits, secret information and secret identities.

If you are participating and found this by coincidence, please do not look further.

####
Deployment:

```Flask --app agent_console run```

Next steps:
- install virtual ubuntu for coding
- refactor code to work with gunicorn
- deploy to render
- create user models
- create login/logout system
- continue developing the application with required features
- create path system for users (post "path" info with request)
